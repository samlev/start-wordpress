Start Wordpress
===============

This is a horrible project that shouldn't be used by anyone under any circumstances.

### What is it?

It's a shell script which will create WordPress sites in docker. It asks some questions with a GUI. There are _definitely_ better ways to do this.

### Why did you make it then?

Because I wanted a way to give someone who isn't yet CLI-savvy an easy way to start up new WordPress sites to play with themes, etc.

### Why didn't you just make the sites for them, or teach them CLI?

Because I didn't.

### What license is this under?

Umm... Probably [DILLIGASPL](https://github.com/samlev/DILLIGASPL).

### I used this and it broke everything on my computer...

I told you not to use it.

### I'm bad at understanding warnings like "Do not use this", so how do I use it?

Copy the script to you computer, change the 'settings' at the top to sane defaults, make the file executable, and run it. Also probably make sure that you have all the required software installed. Also be on linux, probably.

### What software do I need to install first?

you probably have `curl` and `unzip` installed, but you're much less likely to have `docker`, `docker-compose` and `yad` installed. They're all it uses, though.

### Everything you wrote here is horrible, why would you do this? I have a better way...

I mean like... I don't care? Feel free to tell me a better way to do things, but I won't use it, probably.
